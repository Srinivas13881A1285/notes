Ans - 

it's very very highly scalable in the sense

I can make Apache Nifi to run as a cluster

so horizontally I should be in a position to scale and

it is very very highly configurable

I can make custom processors where I can process any

type of data whether it is structure, semi structure

or unstructured data and whatever the volume of data

SSL
Denser flow
Open computer
Kafka Fling Storm

installation as service in linux ?
start nifi with system booting

Flow Controller -> Controlls how processor should behave and how much amount of resources it should consume

What is FTP ? 

Bulletin - Log file for specific processor ?

Load balancing ? Round robin?

What is CRON job ?
